## QuickCarbEntry

-  Manual Glucose Entry (plus LoopManager handling if necessary)
-  Display slider or wheel for carbs instead of text entry


## Safety Carbs-Entered / Considered limit.

- could probably simplify to a warning threshold and refuse entry above a certain amount
- Not super important, as MaxIOB is doing the same thing essentially

## Consistent placement of "Save" button

- currently 'Pick Food' is the only one with a button on the top right, should probably get one some at the bottom
  or Notes should have a save button on the top right.

## Revisit Insulinmodel Settings

- activity 300, peak 50 was the old model
